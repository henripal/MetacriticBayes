# MetacriticBayes
### Project goals:
- get some data about which critics like which movies
- do some basic analytics on that
- implement a CF algo by asking user to rate movies and outputting which critic he is most similar to

### Done so far:
- implemented the data scraping (see [here](./src/Movies.py) for implementation)
- ran data scraping (see [scraping_notebook](./notebooks/scraping_notebook.ipynb))
- started doing basic analytics and realized the data needed shrinkage badly
- implemented a basic EmpiricalBayes julia package: [EmpiricalBayes.jl](github.com/henripal/EmpiricalBayes.jl)
- started looking at the data and using the EB package in [exploratory_analysis](./notebooks/exploratory_analysis)
